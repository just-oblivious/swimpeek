# SwimPeek for Swimlane Turbine

SwimPeek "connects the dots" between playbooks, components, applications, and other resources in Swimlane Turbine.

With SwimPeek you can browse relationships between resources and answer questions like:
- What playbooks are triggered when a record is created or modified in this application?
- What playbook-actions touch records in this application?
- Where is this component used?

*This tool works by requesting configuration data from a Swimlane Turbine tenant and turning it into a graph-like data structure, this graph can then be navigated in a [fancy terminal UI](https://charm.land/).*


## Limitations

- A cloud-hosted instance is assumed, on-prem deployments are not supported (I don't have access to one for testing);
- Only Turbine content is supported, legacy content is ignored;
- SwimPeek was developed with Turbine v25.3.1 in mind, there's no guarantee that this tool keeps working for newer releases;
- This tool was created by ~~reading the tea leaves~~ analyzing API responses, the output may not be 100% accurate.
